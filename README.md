# Thin Ice Pygame Edition :)

This Python project is a faithful remake of Club Penguin's arcade mini game, Thin Ice! The basic gist of the game is for you to reach to the exit tile, gaining more score as you walk on more tiles. As you go further in, more mechanics are introduced to increase difficulty.
